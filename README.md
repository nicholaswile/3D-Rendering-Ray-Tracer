# 3D Renderer - Ray Tracing
This is a work in progress. Each branch represents a different basic feature of the ray tracer. Currently flat colors are rendered. I plan to add lighting, shadows, and reflections.

## Lighting (Current)

### Specular 
Up next after I fix diffuse reflections. 

### Diffuse (done)
Ambient, point, and directional light reflections are implemented.

There are some weird deformations with the spheres. [Fixed]

### Ambient only 
Flat shading with an equal intensity for all objects in the scene.

## Flat Color (Done)
Parameterized spheres are rendered with flat colors.
